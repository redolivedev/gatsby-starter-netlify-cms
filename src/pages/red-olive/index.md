## WE ARE REAL PEOPLE

### SOLVING REAL PROBLEMS

Located between the Wasatch Mountains and the up-and-coming Silicon Slopes, Red Olive has been pushing the boundaries of digital marketing since 1999. As an award-winning digital agency, we know what it takes for our work to stand out. We’re a team driven by the impossible. We’re dreamers and doers, creatives and technologists. We’re the kids you saw in class wondering, “how in the hell did they build that?”

Fueled by excessive amounts of caffeine and burning the midnight oil, we develop our strategies around specific needs so that our clients can see real benefits. We find meaningful solutions and meet each of our challenges head-on. With an in-depth understanding of the market, we plan out strategies by asking the right questions and taking well-planned risks. Let us work together to give your project our all.
